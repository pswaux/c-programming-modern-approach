Modify the ```qsort.c``` program of ```Section 9.6``` so that the quicksort and split<br />
functions are in a separate file named ```quicksort.c```. Create a header file named<br />
```quicksort.h``` that contains prototypes for the two functions and have both<br />
```qsort.c``` and ```quicksort.c``` include this file.

(please don't forget to create bin folder if you want to use Makefile)
