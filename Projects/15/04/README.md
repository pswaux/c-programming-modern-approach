Modify the ```remind.c``` program of ```Section 13.5``` so that the<br />
```read_line function``` is in a separate file named ```readline.c```.<br />
Create a header file named ```readline.h``` that contains a prototype<br />
for the function and have both ```remind.c``` and ```readline.c``` include this file.

(please don't forget to create bin folder if you want to use Makefile)
