The justify program of Section 15.3 justifies lines by inserting extra spaces between words.\
The way the write line function currently works, the words closer to the end of a line tend\
to have slightly wider gaps between them than the words at the beginning.
(For example, \
the words closer to the end might have three spaces between them, while the
words closer \
to the beginning might be separated by only two spaces.) Improve the program
by having write_line \
alternate between putting the larger gaps at the end of the line and
putting them at the beginning of the line.
