The ```justify``` program of ```Section 15.3``` justifies lines by inserting extra spaces between words.<br />
The way the ```write_line function``` currently works, the words closer to the end of a line tend<br />
to have slightly wider gaps between them than the words at the beginning.
(For example,<br />
the words closer to the end might have three spaces between them, while the
words closer<br />
to the beginning might be separated by only two spaces.) Improve the program
by having ```write_line```<br />
alternate between putting the larger gaps at the end of the line and
putting them at the beginning of the line.
