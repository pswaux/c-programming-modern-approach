c  is  quirky,  flawed,  and  an  enormous success. Although
accidents of history surely helped, it evidently satisfied a
need  for a system implementationlangua* efficient enough to
displace  assembly  language,  yet  sufficientlyabstract* to
describe  algorithms  and  interactions in a wide variety of
environments. -- Dennis M. Ritchie
