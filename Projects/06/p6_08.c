/**
 *
 * Write a program that prints a one-month calendar.
 * The user specifies the number of days in the month
 * and the day of the week on which the month begins:
 *
 *    Enter number of days in month: 31
 *    Enter starting day of the week (1=Sun, 7=Sat): 3
 *
 *             1   2   3   4   5
 *     6   7   8   9  10  11  12
 *    13  14  15  16  17  18  19
 *    20  21  22  23  24  25  26
 *    27  28  29  30  31
 *
 * Hint: This program isnâ€™t as hard as it looks. The most important
 * part is a for statement that uses a variable i to count from 1 to n
 * where n is the number of days in the month, printing each value of i.
 * Inside the loop, an if statement tests whether i is the last day in a week;
 * if so, it prints a new-line character.
